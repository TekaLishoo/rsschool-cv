    <p>Honey, Let Me Sing You a Song Lyrics</p>
    
        <p>Maybe I'm blind, maybe I'm blind</p>
        <p>Oh, I couldn't see you shine</p>
        <p>And shimmer right in front of my eyes</p>
        <p>Front of my eyes, oh no</p>
        <p>I never saw light, never saw light</p>
        <p>All I saw were faded mirrors</p>
        <p>And dim reflections but</p>
        <p>You shine, you shine so much brighter, oh</p>
